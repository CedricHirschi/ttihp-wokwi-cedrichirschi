## How it works

This project is just a simple test for this Wokwi workflow, so it does not include any very meaningful functionality!

The decimal point should blink with a frequency of $f_{blink} = \frac{f_{clk}}{2^14} = \frac{10 kHz}{2^14} = 0.61 Hz $

Inputs 0 to 6 are routed directly so segments A to G.

## How to test

No inputs need to be applied other than the clock of 10kHz for the decimal point to blink.

Toggling inputs 0 to 6 should toggle segment A to G respectively.

## External hardware

None, only the 7 segment display and DIP switches
