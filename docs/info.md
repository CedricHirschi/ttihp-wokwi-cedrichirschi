## How it works

This project is just a simple test for this Wokwi workflow, so it does not include any very meaningful functionality!

Segment A should blink with a frequency of $f_{blink} = \frac{f_{clk}}{2^14} = \frac{10 kHz}{2^14} = 0.61 Hz $

## How to test

No inputs need to applied other than the clock of 10kHz.

## External hardware

None, only the 7 segment display
